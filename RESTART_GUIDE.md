   cd portfolio-backend
   rm -rf .next
   ```

3. **Restart the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in your browser**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000
   - **Hard refresh** the page: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux)

## What You'll See

## Troubleshooting

If you still see the old design:

1. **Clear browser cache completely**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click the refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

2. **Check you're on the right port**
   - Make sure you're visiting `localhost:3000`
   - Not an old cached version

3. **Verify the server started correctly**
   - Check terminal for any errors
   - Should say "Ready in Xms" with no errors
